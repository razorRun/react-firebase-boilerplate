# react-firebase-boilerplate

React - Firebase boilerplate. I have enabled firebase cloud functions & hosting. At the time of writing it has the latest react starter app. And expecting to add features like git/bitbucket CICD etc.

### To start

1. Clone the repo.
2. run `npm run setup`
3. Make sure you answer `web/build` to "What do you want to use as your public directory?"
4. If everything went right you should be able to see the app on [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/)

Tip: To serve the app later, run `firebase serve` or `npm run serve`
